         * How it works:
         * 1. We keep adding elements and tracking running sum
         * 2. If we encounter a sum we've seen before:
         * - It means elements after the previous occurrence of this sum
         * up to current index must sum to zero
         * - Because: if sum up to index i = X
         * and sum up to index j = X
         * then sum of elements between i and j = 0
         * 3. We keep track of the maximum such length found
         *
         * Time Complexity: O(n) - single pass through array
         * Space Complexity: O(n) - for HashMap
